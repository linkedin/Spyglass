A sample application demonstrating the Spyglass library. See [here](../README.md) for documentation about the library itself.

Samples
-------

Here is a list of samples within this app in order of increasing complexity:

1. **Basic Demo**

   Shows the most basic implementation of mentions possible using a `RichEditorView`.
   
2. **Network Demo**

   Demonstrates how network latency affects how Spyglass performs. Contains a slider allowing you to adjust the mocked network latency.
   
3. **Multiple Suggestion Source Demo **

   Shows how to implement suggestions when they are gathered from multiple potential sources.
   
4. **Grid Suggestions Demo**

   Demonstrates using a `MentionsEditText` to display suggestions using a custom `RecyclerView` in a grid-like layout.
